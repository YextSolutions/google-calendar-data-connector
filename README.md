# Product Description



The Google Calendar Events Connector was built to allow Yext customers to easily import their event entities into the Knowledge Graph. The app uses OAuth, such that when users download it, they will connect to their Google account. After connecting to your Google account, you can choose which calendars to pull into Yext, and the events will start to appear in the KG! The app automatically pulls in the following fields from the Google Calendar events:

- Name
- Entity ID
- Calendar ID
- Calendar Name
- Calendar Timezone
- Date/Time Start
- Landing Page URL
- Color
- Event Creator Name
- Event Creator Email
- Organizer Name
- Organizer Email
- Meeting Type
- Meeting Link
- Meeting Phone
